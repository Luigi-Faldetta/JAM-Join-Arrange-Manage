# intro
Welcome to DoShiTo! If you've made it this far you already know we are an event planning app aimed at making it easier to both plan get togethers with friends and split the cost of having them, be it a group trip to vegas or a movie night with pizza.  What you are really interested in is how we have made such an amazing app and you want to see this masterpiece of code, so let's take a look!

# setup
For starters, please sure you have node installed.  From there you will have to run "npm install" from both the client folder and the server file.

# getting started
To run the backend, navigate to the server file from the root directory and run "npm run server"

to run the frontend, navigate to the client file from the root directory and run "npm start"

we are using postges for our db, so make sure you are familiar with it.

# testing
testing is presently consolidated to either front end or backend, however the command is the same. simply run "npm test" from either the server or client folders to run their respective tests.  

on the backend, jest should run normally in the terminal.  

frontend testing is done with cypress.  if you have not used it before there will be some very minor set up that it will guide you through.
